        <h2>Sconehenge Sunrise Sessions</h2>
        <p>At the historic Sconehenge site, the band played a sunrise acoustic set that had fans waking up early and rising like dough. With flour floating in the air and cinnamon vibes rolling through the fog, songs like “Baker Street Blues” and “Sticky Situation” were reimagined with heart and harmony. A batch of fresh hits, both new and nostalgic, left the audience toasted and thrilled.</p>

        <h2>The Oven Dome Spectacular</h2>
        <p>The Rolling Scones brought the heat to The Oven Dome in Crumb City. Lasers, layered harmonies, and a stage shaped like a giant whisk set the mood. Frontman Crusty Richards wowed the crowd with his flaky vocals and perfectly risen notes. The night ended with a 12-minute jam of “Let It Bleed (and Cool Slightly),” causing an eruption of cheers and flour-tossing in the mosh pit.</p>

        <h2>Crumbs & Chaos in Croissantville</h2>
        <p>The band took over Croissantville's Creamery Park in a wild, sugar-fueled frenzy of music and pastry art. Fans danced, dipped, and devoured every note. Their hit ballad “Sweet Roll of Mine” brought tears, while “Gimme Sugar” caused an unexpected frosting fight near the front row. Security had to clear the stage after a rogue éclair hit the cymbals, but the Scones played on undeterred.</p>

        <h2>Final Jam at Jamsterdam</h2>
        <p>Closing the tour in style, The Rolling Scones brought their sticky-fingered rock to a sold-out crowd in Jamsterdam. Every song was a fresh-baked banger, with “Sympathy for the Danish” stealing the spotlight. Fans swayed with jam jars lit like candles, and the encore featured a mash-up of fan favorites topped with whipped guitar solos. It was a bittersweet farewell, until next season’s tour: “Knead You Now.”</p>
